# SQL-NULL-HANDLING-
SQL NULL HANDLING 

--DIFFERENT WAYS OF NULL HANDLING 

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPTID IS NULL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPTID IS NOT NULL

SELECT COALESCE(FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, 'NOT EXISTS') FROM EMPLOYEE
SELECT ISNULL(FIRSTNAME, 'NOT EXISTS') FROM EMPLOYEE

SELECT FIRSTNAME, 
CASE 
    WHEN FIRSTNAME IS NULL THEN LASTNAME 
	WHEN LASTNAME IS NULL THEN 'LAST NAME NOT EXISTS'
    ELSE 'NA' 
END AS DEPARTMENT 
FROM EMPLOYEE;

--INSERTING DEFAULT VALUES FOR NULL FIELDS WHEN DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE TABLE.
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    ID INT,
    NAME VARCHAR(100),
    DEPARTMENT VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'UNASSIGNED'
);

-- RETURNING NULL IF SALARY IS 100 (THE NULLIF FUNCTION RETURNS NULL IF THE TWO ARGUMENTS ARE EQUAL.)
SELECT NAME, NULLIF(SALARY, 100) AS SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES;

--GROUP BY WITH NULL VALUES
--WHEN USING GROUP BY, NULL VALUES ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE GROUP. ALL ROWS WITH NULL VALUES IN THE GROUPED COLUMN ARE GROUPED TOGETHER.

--TIPS FOR HANDLING NULL WITH AGGREGATES

--DEFAULT VALUES: USE FUNCTIONS LIKE COALESCE TO REPLACE NULL VALUES WITH DEFAULT VALUES IN AGGREGATES.

-- SUM OF SALARIES, REPLACING NULL WITH 0
SELECT SUM(COALESCE(SALARY, 0)) FROM EMPLOYEE;
SELECT SUM(ISNULL(SALARY, 0)) FROM EMPLOYEE;

--FILTERING NULLS: FILTER OUT NULL VALUES EXPLICITLY IF NEEDED.

-- COUNT NON-NULL SALARIES
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;
--NULL HANDLING IN GROUPING: BE AWARE THAT NULLS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN GROUP BY QUERIES.

-- GROUP BY DEPARTMENT AND HANDLE NULL
SELECT COALESCE(DEPARTMENT, 'UNKNOWN') AS DEPARTMENT, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPTID

--HANDLING NULL VALUES IN JOIN CONDITIONS (NULL IS NOT EQUALS TO NULL IN SQL)

SELECT E.FIRSTNAME, D.DEPTNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
LEFT JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON ISNULL(E.DEPTID, 0) = ISNULL(D.ID, 0);

--HANDLING NULL VALUES IN JOIN CONDITIONS 
SELECT E.FIRSTNAME, D.DEPTNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
LEFT JOIN DEPARTMENT D 
ON (CASE 
    WHEN E.DEPTID IS NULL THEN 1
    ELSE E.DEPTID 
    END) = D.DEPTNAME;
